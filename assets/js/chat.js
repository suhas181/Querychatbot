   chat.js — Student chatbot interface
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Two clearly separated responsibilities:

     1. The conversation UI  — bubbles, typing indicator, chips, composer.
        This part is final. It does not change when the backend arrives.

     2. resolveAnswer()      — decides which stored answer replies to a
        question. ★ THIS IS THE MACHINE LEARNING SEAM. ★

   For the prototype, resolveAnswer() does a plain keyword count against the
   question bank in the browser. It is deliberately simple and is NOT a model.
   In the real system this function hands the question to the Python backend,
   which performs the actual pipeline:

        raw question
          → NLP preprocessing (tokenise, stopword removal, stemming)
          → TF-IDF feature extraction
          → Naive Bayes classification
          → answer looked up in the MySQL `questions` table
          → answer returned here

   Nothing else in this file needs to change for that swap. No machine
   learning is implemented in JavaScript anywhere in this project.
